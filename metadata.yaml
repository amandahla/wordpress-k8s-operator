# This is how we would declare the image if we want to attach it as a
# juju resource. This is helpful if you are publishing to the charm
# store and wish to tie the published charm to a particular image
# revision. But for IS use cases, it seems better to specify the
# image address as charm config, or hardcode or introspect the
# registry to specify an image by tag.

# resources:
#   image:
#     type: oci-image
#     description: Docker image, needs 'charm attach' or 'juju deploy --resource'.
    
# Most Django apps will need a PostgreSQL database relation or two.
